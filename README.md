# WeatherApp

Basic Vanilla JS Weather App.
This is a basic weather App based on an introductory vanilla Javascript tutorial I have been going through.  It fetches live weather data from openweathermap.org API and displays it on the page. I have been experimenting with some basic javascript operations so the code you find here will not be the most efficient.
